Welcome to my personal website! I am an Information Scientist at the [RAND Corporation](www.rand.org) where I conduct quantitative, data-driven research into a wide range of policy problems. My main areas of interest areas artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I am also very interested in the intersection of machine learning with theoretical physics.

My *brief* professional worldline: prior to joining RAND I was a postdoc at the University of Southampton's School of Mathematical Sciences where I studied gravitational aspects of string theory. Before that I spent 6 wonderful years earning my PhD in physics at UCSB under my advisor Gary Horowitz, and before that I studied physics and math at Syracuse University and worked closely with Mark Bowick and Cristina Marchetti.

I now live in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco with my wife, Aleesa Alexander, and our new Shiba Inu puppy [Panko](https://z-p3.www.instagram.com/panko_the_shiba/).
