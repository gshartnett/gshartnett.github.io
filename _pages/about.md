Welcome to my personal website! I am an Information Scientist at the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/about/people/h/hartnett_gavin_s.html) where I conduct quantitative, data-driven research into a wide range of policy problems. My main areas of interest areas artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I am also very interested in the intersection of machine learning with theoretical physics.

My professional worldline: prior to joining RAND I was a postdoc at the University of Southampton's School of Mathematical Sciences where I studied gravitational aspects of string theory. Before that I spent 6 wonderful years earning my PhD in physics at UCSB under my advisor Gary Horowitz, and before that I studied physics and math at Syracuse University and worked closely with Mark Bowick and Cristina Marchetti.
