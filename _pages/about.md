Welcome to my personal website! I am an Information Scientist at the RAND Corporation, where I conduct quantitative, data-driven research into a wide range of policy problems. I am also a professor at the Pardee RAND Graduate School.

In recent years I have worked on an eclectic range of problems, including building computational models of epidemics, studying the AI safety implications of adversarial examples designed to fool computer vision models, studying the physics of nuclear weapons effects, and using graph neural networks to solve public policy problems. I have also worked on the physics of spin-glasses and quantum computing, and in how recent advances in machine learning may be used to improve current algorithms and techniques for these systems.

My worldline, in a nutshell: prior to joining RAND, I studied black holes in string theory as a postdoc at the Southampton Theory Astrophysics and Gravitation (STAG) Research Centre in the UK, and before I was a PhD student at the University of California at Santa Barbara. My research focused on the existence and stability of black holes, and in using properties of black holes to understand phenomena in strongly coupled gauge theories through the gauge/gravity correspondence. Going back even further, as an undergraduate at Syracuse University, I researched gravitational waves as part of the LIGO collaboration, the expansion of the early universe, as well as topological defects in liquid crystals.
