## Quantum Computing

### [Recent Research Publications](/projects/quantum-computing/)
My quantum computing research has resulted in several high-impact publications demonstrating practical advances in near-term quantum systems. Key achievements include the largest demonstration of a GHZ state with genuine multipartite entanglement ([75 qubits](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/2021/01/29/reference-list-for-records-in-large-entanglement-generation-number-of-qubits-in-ghz-states/)), a novel long-range teleportation-based CNOT gate achieving >85% fidelity across 40 lattice sites, and the first demonstrations where gate-model quantum computers outperform quantum annealers for optimization problems.

## Public Policy

### [AI and Public Policy](/projects/ai-policy/)
Conducted research on adversarial machine learning vulnerabilities and defense policy NLP analysis, while contributing to AI safety through red-teaming efforts with OpenAI and Meta and founding RAND's influential AI research community.

### [Network Science Approaches for Public Policy](/projects/network-science/)
Developed deep learning methods for synthetic network generation and applied network science to optimize vaccination strategies during pandemics.

### [Nuclear Weapons Effects Modeling](/projects/nuclear-weapons-effect/)
Development of new numerical code for the Karzas-Latter-Seiler model of high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects.
