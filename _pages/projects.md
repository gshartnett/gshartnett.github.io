## Quantum Computing Projects

### Photonic Circuit Optimization
Resurrected and completed a previously-abandoned project for numerically optimizing state preparation circuits for photonic quantum computers. Required rapid acquisition of expertise in linear optical quantum computing.

### Protein Folding Optimization
Developing lattice-based approaches to formulate protein folding problems as combinatorial optimization problems suitable for quantum computers, in collaboration with external partners.

### Error Suppression Technology Platform
Led "tiger team" initiative to build shared codebase for core error suppression technology, coordinating 3-4 engineers and 2 researchers to bridge research and engineering teams.

## Public Policy

### [Nuclear Weapons Effects Modeling](/projects/nuclear-weapons-effect/)
Development of new numerical code for the Karzas-Latter-Seiler model of high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects.

### [Network Science Approaches for Public Policy](/projects/network-science/)
Developed deep learning methods for synthetic network generation and applied network science to optimize vaccination strategies during pandemics.

### [AI and Public Policy](/projects/ai-policy/)
Conducted research on adversarial machine learning vulnerabilities and defense policy NLP analysis, while contributing to AI safety through red-teaming efforts with OpenAI and Meta and founding RAND's influential AI research community.
