## Quantum Computing Projects

### Photonic Circuit Optimization
Resurrected and completed a previously-abandoned project for numerically optimizing state preparation circuits for photonic quantum computers. Required rapid acquisition of expertise in linear optical quantum computing.

### Protein Folding Optimization
Developing lattice-based approaches to formulate protein folding problems as combinatorial optimization problems suitable for quantum computers, in collaboration with external partners.

### Error Suppression Technology Platform
Led "tiger team" initiative to build shared codebase for core error suppression technology, coordinating 3-4 engineers and 2 researchers to bridge research and engineering teams.

## Defense & Policy Research

### [Nuclear Weapons Effects Modeling](/projects/nuclear-weapons-effect/)
Development of new numerical code for the Karzas-Latter-Seiler model of high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects.

## Machine Learning & AI Projects

### Large Language Model Red-teaming
Conducted safety and security testing for major language models including Meta's models and OpenAI's GPT-4.

### AI Study Circle at RAND
Built and grew internal AI community from concept to 140+ researchers across 4 offices with 30-40 regular attendees.

### COVID-19 Contact Network Modeling
Developed city-scale contact network models for understanding pandemic spread and intervention effectiveness.

## Research Software

### Quantum Circuit Layout Selection
Machine learning approach for optimizing quantum circuit performance across different hardware platforms.
